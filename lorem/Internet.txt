<p>YouTube Kids (which has been available in the US since February) isn't a substitute for parental involvement. YouTube stresses that the content is controlled by algorithm rather than being curated, and there could be lapses that parents will need to flag (using the in-app flagging system).</p>
<p>While some took to the change hesitantly, that "liking" with a heart symbol over "favoriting" with a star has shown to be popular says something about how social media can engage with users worldwide. If nothing else, "liking" is more commonly accepted term across languages than the English-style "verbing a noun" seen in the word "favoriting."</p>
<p>Cloud storage makes everything simpler. Instead of transferring media files to your phone you simply stream MP3s or movies from faraway servers. Instead of copying crucial documents to flash drives or burning them to disc, you stick them in the cloud where they can't be left in the office or on a train.</p>
<p>ISPs won't hand over details of the actual pages you visit or contents of your communications without a warrant, but site URLs can make it abundantly clear what they're about: you don't visit Wonga.com if you're financially stable, for example. Similarly, location data can say a lot about you - churchgoing, perhaps, or visiting a particular building at particular times when Alcoholics Anonymous just happens to be meeting.</p>
<p>It may be totally in service of AWS' core offering of cloud storage, but Snowball isn't just one piece of hardware. It's two. On the side of every Snowball is a Kindle – an e-Ink version like the Paperwhite rather than a tablet like the Fire – which serves as both an address label and a tracking device. Snowballs can be daisy-chained, too, so together they can carry vast datasets.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also making other changes, and in what seems a miserly move – and definitely nothing to do with abuse – the free storage limit on OneDrive is being slashed from 15GB to 5GB. Sadly that's happening for existing users as well as those new to OneDrive, and the free limit will be decreased from early next year. The 15GB camera roll bonus is also being done away with.</p>
<p>The survey also found that 62% of respondents have noticed that significantly more customers are making online payments, and 65% said folks are increasingly using different devices (computers, tablets, mobiles and so forth) to perform online transactions. However, only 53% of companies have introduced two-factor authentication, and just half of organisations operate a real-time antifraud solution.</p>
<p>There's no doubt that the internet has done well. At the time of writing there are 3.2 billion people online – an impressive 40.4% of humanity – according to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). It's tripled in popularity in the last decade, but its growth is now badly slowing. The stratospheric growth of the internet in its early years is understandable – the number of users almost doubled in 1999 and again in 2000 – but since Schmidt's proclamation the internet has had to settle for around 8% annual growth, a figure that's reducing each year.</p>
<p>While Facebook said that it won't be specifying exactly how it is able to determine that a government is backing an attack on your account, it explained that it would only send you the warning notification "only in situations where the evidence strongly supports our conclusion."</p>
<p>The future of personalised marketing fits perfectly with Instagram, and since it's owned by Facebook, it's no wonder that Instagram is now on a drive to make money. The world's marketeers are already busy Instgramming their brands. Can Instagram – currently enjoying 40% year-on-year growth – rule in the coming era of 'social commerce'?</p>
